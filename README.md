This was a rough assignment to come back to after break. I Felt like I made a good amount of progress and then hit a wall and realized I did everything wrong. I pseudocoded how I think the rest of my code should go but realize now I should have done it completely differently. Probably got too ambitious trying to generate the questions dynamically at this point.
